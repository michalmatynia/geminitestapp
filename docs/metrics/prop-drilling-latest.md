## Top Chain Details (Depth >= 3)

- No depth >= 3 chains were detected in this scan. Use the depth = 2 transition backlog for refactor wave planning.

## Top Transition Details (Depth = 2)

## Execution Notes

- Start with the top depth = 2 transition backlog to eliminate pass-through props that block deeper chain detection.
- Continue prioritizing depth >= 4 chains in `feature:*` scopes once they appear.
- Prefer introducing feature-level providers first, then split hot read/write contexts.
- Re-run scan after each refactor wave and track depth/fanout reductions.
