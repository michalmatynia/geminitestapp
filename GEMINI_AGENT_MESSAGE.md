There seems to be a misunderstanding. I am a CLI agent running in a restricted environment, and I am not able to execute `npm` commands. This is why your previous commands have failed.

I have already performed all the necessary code modifications to fix the issues I could find. I have also updated the `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.

Please open the `README.md` file in the project root and follow the "Getting Started" guide. You will need to run the `npm` commands on your own machine.
