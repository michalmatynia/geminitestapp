5. Tool selection & fallback strategy (small model for routing)
6. Loop detection + recovery (fast heuristic + LLM guard) V
7. Safety/approval gate checks (separate policy model) V
8. DOM/selector inference (cheap model good at pattern matching) V
9. Result formatting/normalization (small model to clean outputs) V

when planning or replanning of Agent Job was done by a specific model, stamp the model signature and make it visible Job details
