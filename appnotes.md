I load the import list in the Limit of 10, yet when I see the Import list preview is says Total: 1000 · Existing: 0 · Showing: 1000

Move the pagination in Product List under Min Price Max Price Fields 


* Underneath the navigation panel in Product list, I need another panel. The first button is checked products settings, It will dropdown with the following options On this Page: "Check All" "Uncheck All" On All Pages "Check All" "Uncheck All"


* When I change the catalog to unassigned it still shows Products listed which are part of the catalog


## Filters
Add one button called Filter option that will hide show all available search fields and filter fields
When I click on that button, add another button below called Advanced filters, which reaveals a new panel over the basic filters, in this Panel I should be able to set up filtering conditions for more advanced searches.

In each product row, between a checkmark and an image I need a star that will mark the product as favourite, but upon clicking it, it will give me seven different color stars each being its own variant of favourite. Search by different star colors filter should be added to a basic filter section.

The state of the folder tree (which folders are collapsed or uncollapsed), should be kept in the database for retention
The same goes for folder tree whether it's in a collapsed or expanded state at the moment, it should be kept in the database.

## Note history
Undo history during edit
At some point there should be note import and also the notes should be downloadable as markdown

## Note App Chatbot connection
Apply GPT Notes

Infer text from image and write a snippet

have AI to format my notes, validate the truth in my notes, Search the web to validate my notes, give me note suggestions (that I can Accept or Refuse), extend/refactor my notes, 

Make code AI Valide code snippets

Prompted search, I can search by means of

# Note Taking App END

base.com with email: you@example.com password: YourPassword
remove  Agent job panel from the chatbox window, it duplicates what is already shown


Move image/catalog operations behind a data-access abstraction so Mongo can fully own product data.

# Database work
Set the cloud database mongoDB backup to local mongoDB setUP
Add MongoDB connections to Chatbot and agentic flow
Add MongoDB connections to CMS
Add MongoDB connections to Application Settings in General

# Address Redundancy

Integration with Base

# Set Global Settings
* Move Product Database Choice there
* Choose Global Database as well as individual database for different aspects of the page.

# Develop components
Enhance Components
Make components more robust and modular
Segment them into proper sections

# Agentic AI
Enhance functionality of
1. Planner/replanner vs. executor (already split for you) V
2. Self‑questioning/critique (already split for you) V
* Enhance agentic per step * 3. Extraction/validation model (evidence checking, schema validation, de‑duplication) V
4. Memory validation + summarization (fast model to filter, stronger model to write) V
5. Tool selection & fallback strategy (small model for routing)
6. Loop detection + recovery (fast heuristic + LLM guard) V
7. Safety/approval gate checks (separate policy model) V
8. DOM/selector inference (cheap model good at pattern matching) V
9. Result formatting/normalization (small model to clean outputs) V

when planning or replanning of Agent Job was done by a specific model, stamp the model signature and make it visible Job details
ETC.

segment agent engine.ts and make it modular
disassociate types models
increase type safety

I need the ability to take control and log in to the website and give back control. I need a mini website viewer


Sending another prompt during an agent work means I am adjusting, so at this point stop running, do a replan taking the last prompt into consideration and adjust behavior

Connect GPT API to my Agentic Framework
